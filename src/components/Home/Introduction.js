        As a front-end developer, it is imperative to keep sharpening your
        skills, updating knowledge, and tapping into some unfamiliar
        territories. Although there are tons of tutorials, articles, books,
        talks or codepens, nothing could compare to real hands-on projects. It's
        time to get your hands dirty, make mistakes, break things, fix things,
        slowly buildup a sturdy understanding of the hardcore concepts, and gain
        some real experiences.

        We encourage anyone, especially junior developers interested in React,
        to take on some of the projects. Write some code and compare what you
        did with our Github repo. Chances are you would do better, or you might
        have some blockers. Either way, we could all gain something in the end.
