        As a front-end developer, it is imperative to keep sharpening your
        skills, updating knowledge, and tapping into some unfamiliar territory
        where you have never encountered. Although there already are tons of
        tutorials, articles, books, talks or codepens, nothing could ever
        compare to some real hands-on projects. Get your hands dirty, make
        mistakes, break things, fix things, slowly buildup a sturdy
        understanding of the hardcore concepts, and gain some real experiences.

        This website is a personal project about implementing some of the key
        concepts I learned when studying in Lambda school. It is a demonstration
        of a series of 20 projects that are all made by React and other related
        technology such as React-Router, Hooks, Material-UI, etc. These projects
        are inspired by Brad Travery's Udemy course-- 20 Web Projects With
        Vanilla JavaScript. Each project emphasizes different things, including
        JavaScript fundamentals, DOM Manipulation, API & JSON, High Order Array
        Methods and more.

        I encourage anyone, especially junior developers interested in React, to
        take on some of the projects. Write some code and compare what you did
        with mine. Chances are you would do better, or you might have some
        blockers as I did. Either way, we could all gain something in the end.
