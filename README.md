# React mini projects

### Why mini projects

This website is a project about implementing some of the key concepts I learned when studying in Lambda School. It is a demonstration of a series of projects that are all made by React and other related technology such as React-Router, Hooks, Material-UI, etc. These projects are inspired by Brad Travery's Udemy course-- 20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript. Each project emphasizes different things, including JavaScript fundamentals, DOM Manipulation, API & JSON, High Order Array Methods and more.
